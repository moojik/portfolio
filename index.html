                    <p>Hello my name is Mohit Kumar Uppal and I am a front end web developer. Now you will ask who is front end web developer and what he does. To tell the truth, even a few months ago I also did not know anything about it and now I myself a front end web developer. So a front end developer is one who designs an entire website that creats the outlook that we seen on the computer screen and that's called front end web developemnt.Apart from this, there are many other types of web development such as Back End and Full Stack Web Development, on which you can get more information on Google.<br />As you know that I have learned this a few months ago, before that I graduated in Commerce and When I was completing my studies, I never thought that I would ever come to this line and It's always in my mind that I should do any business or work in a good company. As it is said that whatever happens is for good and I am very happy with all this. That's all about me.

                        <p>Uppal bakery is one of the best and famous bake house in our city. They have a large variety of products ranging from bakery to grocery, juices to drinks, frozen items and so on...Before this they are just capturing the local market. So to get customers from outside the local world they decided to go online. Now the remote and nearby customers can easily approach to them and it has became very easy to place their orders then before. It has happened that they are now growing day by day and that's good.</p>
